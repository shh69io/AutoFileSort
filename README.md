### **AutoFileSort**

A Python-based file organizer that helps users automatically categorize files into different directories based on their extensions. The program scans a given directory and moves files into categorized folders such as `Documents`, `Images`, `Audio`, `Video`, `Archive`, `Scripts` and `unsorted` for files with undefined extensions. It generates logs of the file movement, making it easier to track what was done.

---

### **Features**
- **Directory Selection**: User inputs the directory to be sorted.
- **Automatic Directory Creation**: The program creates the necessary output directories if they don't exist.
- **File Categorization**: Files are categorized into predefined folders such as `Documents`, `Images`, `Audio`, `Video`, `Archives`, `Scripts`, and `unsorted` for files with undefined extensions.
- **Duplicate File Handling**: If a file with the same name already exists in the target directory, a unique name is generated by appending a number.
- **Logging**: The program logs all file movements in a `.txt` log file with timestamps for traceability.
- **Real-time Feedback**: The program provides real-time feedback via the command line, informing the user of files being moved.
- **Hidden File Support**: The program now processes hidden files (files that start with a dot).
- **Windows Compatibility**: Fixed the issue with file movement on Windows systems (previously caused by WinError 2).

### **Installation**
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (or download the project files):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoFileSort.git

2. **Install Python 3.5+**:  
   Ensure [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher is installed on your system. You can download it from the official site.

3. **Dependencies**:
   The project relies on built-in Python libraries, so no external dependencies are required.

---

### **Usage**
1. **Run the Script**:
   In your terminal, navigate to the project folder and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python AutoFileSort.py
   ```

2. **Enter the Directory Path**:
   When prompted, enter the path to the directory you wish to organize. Make sure the directory exists and contains the files you want to organize.

3. **File Categorization**:
   The program will automatically sort the files based on their extensions and move them into the following directories inside an `output` folder:
   - `Documents`: `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.doc`, `.xls`, `.ppt`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`
   - `Images`: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`, `.svg`
   - `Audio`: `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aac`, `.ogg`, `.flac`, `.wma`
   - `Video`: `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.flv`, `.wmv`, `.webm`
   - `Archives`: `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`, `.tar`, `.gz`
   - `Scripts`: `.py`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.json`, `.xml`
   - `Unsorted`: Files with extensions not defined in the program will be moved here.

4. **Log Files**:
   A log file will be created in the format `logXXXXXX.txt` (where `XXXXXX` is a random identifier) in the project directory. This file will contain details of each file moved, e.g.:
   ```
   Moved file1.jpg from /path/to/input/directory/ to output/images.
   Moved report.pdf from /path/to/input/directory/ to output/documents.
   ```

### **How It Works**

1. **Input Directory**: The program asks the user to input the path to the directory that needs to be sorted. It validates whether the directory exists before proceeding.

2. **Directory Creation**: If the `output` directory doesn't exist, it will be created. Additionally, folders for file categories (`documents`, `images`, `audio`, `video`, `archives`, `scripts` and `unsorted`) are dynamically created inside the `output` folder if a file of the respective file-type is to be sorted.

3. **File Sorting**:
   - The program scans the files in the input directory.
   - It checks each file's extension and matches it to the appropriate category.
   - Files are moved into the corresponding category folder in the `output` directory. Files with undefined extensions are moved to the `unsorted` folder.

4. **Logging**: All file movements are logged in a text file for reference, including the timestamp. If a file with the same name already exists in the target folder, the program appends a unique identifier (e.g., `_1`, `_2`, etc.) to avoid overwriting the existing file.

5. **Real-time Feedback**: The program prints out messages in the terminal showing the status of the file moves.

### **Example**
**Input Directory**:  
`/path/to/input/directory/`

**Output Directory**:  
The program will create the following structure:
```
output/
    documents/
        report.pdf
        resume.docx
    images/
        photo.jpg
        picture.png
    audio/
        song.mp3
    video/
        movie.mp4
    unsorted/
        unknown_file.xyz
```

### **Future Updates [Tentative]**
- **Customizable Categories**: Allow the user to define their own categories and extensions, and output path. 
- **GUI Integration**: Consider adding a graphical user interface for easier interaction.
