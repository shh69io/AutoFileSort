### **AutoFileSort**

A Python-based file organizer that helps users automatically categorize files into different directories based on their extensions. The program scans a given directory and moves files into categorized folders such as `Documents`, `Images`, `Audio`, and `Video`. It generates logs of the file movement, making it easier to track what was done.

---

### **Features**
- **Directory Selection**: User inputs the directory to be sorted.
- **Automatic Directory Creation**: The program creates the necessary output directories if they don't exist.
- **File Categorization**: Files are categorized into predefined folders such as `Documents`, `Images`, `Audio`, and `Video` based on their extensions.
- **Duplicate File Handling**: If a file with the same name already exists in the target directory, a unique name is generated by appending a number.
- **Logging**: The program logs all file movements in a `.txt` log file for traceability.

### **Installation**
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (or download the project files):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/File-Organizer.git
   ```

2. **Install Python 3.x**:  
   Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from the official site:  
   [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. **Dependencies**:
   The project relies on built-in Python libraries, so no external dependencies are required.

### **Usage**
1. **Run the Script**:
   In your terminal, navigate to the project folder and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python file_organizer.py
   ```

2. **Enter the Directory Path**:
   When prompted, enter the path to the directory you wish to organize. Make sure the directory exists and contains the files you want to organize.

3. **File Categorization**:
   The program will automatically sort the files based on their extensions and move them into the following directories inside an `output` folder:
   - `Documents`: `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`
   - `Images`: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`
   - `Audio`: `.mp3`, `.wav`
   - `Video`: `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`

4. **Log Files**:
   A log file will be created in the format `logXXXXXX.txt` (where `XXXXXX` is a random identifier) in the project directory. This file will contain details of each file moved, e.g.:
   ```
   Moved file1.jpg to output/images.
   Moved report.pdf to output/documents.
   ```

### **How It Works**

1. **Input Directory**: The program asks the user to input the path to the directory that needs to be sorted. It validates whether the directory exists before proceeding.

2. **Directory Creation**: If the `output` directory doesn't exist, it will be created. Additionally, folders for file categories (`documents`, `images`, `audio`, `video`) are created inside the `output` folder if they don't already exist.

3. **File Sorting**:
   - The program scans the files in the input directory.
   - It checks each file's extension and matches it to the appropriate category.
   - Files are moved into the corresponding category folder in the `output` directory.

4. **Logging**: All file movements are logged in a text file for reference. If a file with the same name already exists in the target folder, the program appends a unique identifier (e.g., `_1`, `_2`, etc.) to avoid overwriting the existing file.

### **Example**
**Input Directory**:  
`/path/to/input/directory/`

**Output Directory**:  
The program will create the following structure:
```
output/
    documents/
        report.pdf
        resume.docx
    images/
        photo.jpg
        picture.png
    audio/
        song.mp3
    video/
        movie.mp4
```

---

### **Future Updates**
- **Additional File Types**: More categories for other file types (e.g., archives, scripts).
- **Customizable Categories**: Allow the user to define their own categories and extensions.
- **GUI Integration**: Consider adding a graphical user interface for easier interaction.
